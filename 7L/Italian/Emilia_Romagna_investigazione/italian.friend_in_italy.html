		<h1>To my friend visiting Italy</h1>
<p>
	To a friend of mine,<br/>
I hear you are going to Emilia Romagna, in Italy! That is brilliant! I hope you have a good time! I’ve been doing some research, and I have some things that you should definitely see and do:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You should climb the Assinelli Tower, one of the two towers of Bologna. I read some reviews about the amazing views, so you should seriously check those out!</li>
<li>
If you are still looking for something historical, you should look around the Castello Estense. It was built in 1385, to protect the Lord of Ferrara. You will be able to witness the moat and drawbridge, and see several different rooms, some including the royal suites.
</li>
<li>
Is it just a rumour,  or did I hear you are becoming more and more interested in your art? If this is so, then you should totally go and wander around inside the Mausoleo di Galla Placida. From the outside it doesn’t look like much, but the inside is incredible. The walls are decorated with mosaics, and the floors are made of marble, it will surely be a highlight of your trip.
</li>
<li>
Try some of the foods! It shouldn’t be very hard to find some amazing quality locally made foods, including balsamic vinegar, and parmesan cheese.
</li>
<li>
Even just wander around Bologna, it is a beautiful city, and just looking around will serve to be delightful. It is historical and modern at the same time, and I know that I long to see it.
</li>
<p>
Have a safe journey, and enjoy yourself! I look forward to catching up when you get back!
</p>
